# Accident Detection and Alerting System Using ESP32

## 🚀 Overview

This project aims to develop an **Accident Detection and Alerting System** using **ESP32, GPS, and an accelerometer**. The system detects sudden vehicle impacts, retrieves location data, and sends alerts to emergency contacts via a web-based platform.

## 📌 Features

- **Real-time Accident Detection** – Uses an accelerometer to identify abrupt changes in motion.
- **GPS Tracking** – Provides precise location coordinates of the accident.
- **Instant Alerts** – Sends notifications to emergency contacts via SMS/email.
- **Buzzer Alert** – Triggers an audible alarm for nearby individuals.
- **IoT-Based Communication** – Web integration for real-time monitoring.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Hardware:** ESP32, GPS Module, Accelerometer, Buzzer
- **Software:** Arduino IDE, Python (for web integration), IoT Cloud

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The ESP32 reads accelerometer and GPS data.
2. **Accident Detection**: The system detects sudden deceleration using predefined thresholds.
3. **Location Retrieval**: GPS provides real-time coordinates.
4. **Alert Notification**: Emergency contacts receive alerts via a web platform.
5. **Local Alert**: The buzzer sounds to notify nearby individuals.
